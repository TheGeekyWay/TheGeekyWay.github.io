  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Welcome to your next tutorial in the C language,  today, we’ll discuss about operators in the C language. We have already discussed about <a href="http://www.thegeekyway.com/variables-in-c/" title="Learning about Variables in C">Variables in C language</a>, and <a href="http://www.thegeekyway.com/learn-c-variables/" title="Learn C – More about variables">how we can store data in variables</a> input by user, next we may need to update this data , or make various operations on the variables to produce desired results. This can be done through Operators in the C language.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><a href="http://thegeekyway.com/uploads/images/2014/01/Operators_in_C1.png" title="Operators in C"><img alt="Operators_in_C" src="http://thegeekyway.com/uploads/images/2014/01/Operators_in_C1.png"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Operators can be classified broadly as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operator</li>
<li>Bitwise</li>
<li>Conditional Operator</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Operators</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we’ll discuss about each category one by one, let us assume that we have declared two variables num1 and num2 and initialized them as shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int num1 = 3;
int num2 = 6;
</pre></div>


<p>Let's have another variable named res for storing result, so that we can analyze the value of result after applying each operator and understand their functioning.</p>
<p>But before this, we need to understand that there are basically two kinds of <em><strong>Operators depending on the number of operands</strong> they operate upon</em>. They are :-</p>
<p><strong>Unary Operators</strong> : which operate on only one operand.</p>
<p><strong>Binary Operators</strong> : which requires two operands to be operated upon.</p>
<p>Now, we'll carry on with understanding different types of operator.</p>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Operators</strong></p>
<p>They are binary operators used to do arithmetic operations like addition , subtraction , multiplication , division etc.</p>
<p><em><u>+ used for addition</u></em> like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>res = num1 + num2;
</pre></div>


<p>This would add the two values ie 5 and 6 and store the result to variable res which is 9 in this case.</p>
<p><em><u>- used for subtraction</u></em> like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>res = num2 - num1;
</pre></div>


<p>This would subtract num1 from num2 and then store the result in variable res which is 3 in this case.</p>
<p><em><u>* used for multiplication</u></em> like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>res = num1 * num2;
</pre></div>


<p>This would multiply num1 and num2 and store the result in variable res which is 18 in this case.</p>
<p><em><u> / used for division</u></em> like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>res = num2 / num1;
</pre></div>


<p>This would divide the two values ie num2 by num1 and then store the result in variable res which is 2 in this case.</p>
<p><em><u>% (modulus operator )</u></em> like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>res = num2 % num1;
</pre></div>


<p>This operator will divide num2 by num1 and then gives us the <em>REMAINDER</em> which will be stored in variable res and it's value would be 0 in this case , since, when 6 is divided by 3, it would give remainder 0.</p>
<p><strong>Logical Operators</strong>:</p>
<p>They are included in logical expressions and are of following types :</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical AND (&amp;&amp;)</li>
<li>Logical NOT ( ! )</li>
<li>Logical OR ( || )</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in Logical AND and Logical OR, we use the respective symbol two times as mentioned. We'll study their complete usage in the coming tutorials specially in <em><u>Loops</u></em> and <em><u>Conditional Statements</u> .</em></p>
<p><strong>Relational Operator:</strong></p>
<p>As the name suggests, they are used to depict relations among variables. Mostly they return either a true (1) value or a false (0) value. They are of the following types :</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than or equal to ( \&lt;= )</li>
<li>More than or equal to ( >= )</li>
<li>Not equal to ( != )</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, they would be better understood when we'll discuss about Conditional Statements and Loops, so we'll discuss them in the upcoming tutorials, just remember the types of operators for now.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Operator:</strong></p>
<p>They are used to assign values to a variables, we are already using this operator since we studied about assigning a value to our variables, so consider the following :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int num = 5;
</pre></div>


<p>Here ( = ) ie assignment operator is used to assign value 5 to variable num.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Operators</strong>:</p>
<p>There are other operators too, but we have covered the most important operators here.</p>
<p>Unary + and Unary - are some of the operators you would see often. As the name suggests they operate on only one operand. To understand what they do, consider the following code snippet :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>int num = 5;
num = (+num);
printf(&quot;Value of num after Unary + is %d n&quot;,&amp;num);
num = -num;
printf(&quot;Value of num after Unary - is %d&quot;,&amp;num);
</pre></div>


<p>Including all the necessary header files and other stuff required, it would produce the output as follows:</p>
<p>Value of num after Unary + is 5</p>
<p>Value of num after Unary - is -5</p>
<p>So, you understood it right Unary + doesn't changed the sign of the value, while unary - reversed the sign of integer value, so +5 become -5 , and it would be vice-versa if we have a negative value in variable.</p>
<p>In the next post, we'll study about Conditional statements and then about Loops in C and their usage, they would help us understand the concept of operators like logical and relational operator in much more detail. If you have any doubts/question, please feel free to flood them in the comments section, we'll help you !</p>
